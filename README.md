# Puflantu
This is a command-line utility designed to translate from Puflantu (a constructed language created by the ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈) to English. It's pretty basic at the moment, but I'll be adding more advance functionality over time.

Flags:
* -t: translate text directly
* -f: read from file
* -s: search dictionary for an English word

Be sure to install from requirements.txt using `pip install -r requirements.txt"`
